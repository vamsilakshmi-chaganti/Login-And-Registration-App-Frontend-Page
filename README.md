This project is a responsive frontend web application for user login and registration, built using HTML5 and CSS3. It features two clearly separated sections within the same page — one for Login and the other for Registration — both styled with a modern, user-friendly layout. The login form asks for a username and password, while the registration form collects more detailed information like first name, last name, email, mobile number, course, and address. All inputs are required, ensuring complete data collection before submission. The layout is responsive and visually clean, making it easy to use across all screen sizes.
